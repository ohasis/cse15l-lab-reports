This is my repository for the course **CSE 15L: Computer Science and Engineering, Software Tools and Technique Labs**.

These labs are the product of ten weeks of work, and reflect the learning of such knowledge as:

* Version Control
* GitHub Methods
* Using Bash Terminals
* Debugging Files
* Creating Remote Servers with Java

This information is reflected in the code and supplementary images of these five lab reports, which were finalized in the spring of 2023.
