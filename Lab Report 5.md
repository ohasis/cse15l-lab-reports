# Lab Report 5
Hello, fellow CS 15L student! Welcome to lab report number five. Today, you will be learning about the debugging process.

## 1. Debugging Scenario

*Original Student Post*

**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. 
Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**

**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, 
command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context 
as you can.**

## 2. Reflection

In the second half of the quarter, I learned more about utilizing A.I. when learning about alternatives to typical programming 
solutions. My lab partner suggested that I try to use Chat GPT to research commands for Lab Report 3, which called for discussing 
variations of command modifications. Given that I had never used A.I. before, I was skeptical when considering this option but 
decided to give it a shot anyway. To my surprise, ChatGPT provided more detailed answers to my questions than I ever could have 
hoped. As I have continued learning in this class, I have found myself willing to ask ChatGPT more and more questions relating to 
different definitions of commands and the potential variations of scenarios in which they may change. Knowing that I will require 
the constant use of `vim` during CSE 30, I believe knowing how to use a dictionary of this type will help me if I ever am confused 
about parsing through lines of code or modifying a method in a particular way.

**Congratulations, you have now learned about debugging, as well as what I learned in the second half of this class!**
