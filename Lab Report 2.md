# Lab Report 2
Hello, fellow CS 15L student! Welcome to lab report number two.

## Part 1


## Part 2


## Part 3

1) I learned more about writing test cases and debugging code in this lab, specifically when it comes to determining the difference between
a symptom and a bug. While a symptom is an inconsistency between test output and input, a bug refers to the specific error in a program.

2) I also learned that, when it comes to writing failure-inducing input, I should note that errors on a small scale will tend to cause 
the same errors on a large scale, which means that writing test cases need not involve arrays of any particularly large sizes.

**Congrats! You have determined what I have learned about writing server files, as well as debugging code!**
