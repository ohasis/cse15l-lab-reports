# Lab Report 3
Hello fellow CSE 15L student! When using the `find` command, be sure to try some of the following command-line configurations.

---

## 1. `find -type`

**a. Example One**

**b. Example Two**

**Source**

Entering the following prompt

```Find 4 interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the find command in bash.```

into ChatGPT granted me the knowledge of the functionality of this option, as well as an example of its syntax in bash.
It was the third example ChatGPT gave, and it was labeled as a command used for filtering by file type.

## 2. `find -maxdepth`

**a. Example One**

**b. Example Two**

**Source**

This was the second result presented to me by ChatGPT after entering the message

```Find 4 interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the find command in bash.```

and it was listed as an option to help limit the depth of a particular search.

## 3. `find -iname`

**a. Example One**

**b. Example Two**

After concluding that the answers to the query listed above had not yielded the most suitable results to the lab
question, I entered an additional message on the same thread in ChatGPT:

```Do you have any more command line options to use the find command?```

ChatGPT yielded the command listed above as the first result, describing it as a tool for a case-insensitive search.

## 4. `find -size`

**a. Example One**

**b. Example Two**

**Source**

The second result of the ChatGPT prompt

```Do you have any more command line options to use the find command?```

this command line option was noted to be for searching by file size.

**Congratulations, you have now learned about potential options regarding use of the `find` command!**
